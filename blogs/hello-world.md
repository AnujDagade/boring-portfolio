# Hello World

Welcome to my new blog! This is a static blog generated from markdown files.

## How it works

1. I write a markdown file in the `blogs/` directory.
2. I run `npm run build`.
3. The script generates an HTML file in `blog/`.

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
